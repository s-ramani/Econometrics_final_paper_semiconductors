The 2020 - 2021 semiconductor chip shortage is a crisis where
the demand has outstripped supply as a result of the snowball effect of
the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the extent to which the
shortage has affected the US automotive industry from 2008 to 2020, by
observing through a microeconomic lens the shifts in both the supply
chain for semiconductor imports and domestic automobile production in
the US. Even though semiconductors may not have been the sole factor
since cars use other inputs and materials, they are an important one in
the automobile production process and could have contributed to the
production decline amidst the pandemic. From 2000 automobile production
has been in a steady decline due to a myriad of factors, such as a
shift towards work from home, rising production costs with technology
investments in quality and input price hikes. Production dipped sharply
in 2020 as a result of the pandemic from 209 to 161 thousand vehicles. Despite
this, the automobile share of semiconductor imports has steadily
increased over the years from 8.8% in 2008 to 11.4% in 2020. This is
primarily because semiconductors are used in the main computerized
technology for cars, and as they become more advanced the demand for
semiconductors have increase irrespective of production declines. There
is therefore a negative correlation between them of -0.74. The shortage
experienced in 2020 is not quite visible from the semiconductor demand,
but rather as a possible factor for the production decline. Manufacturers
were unable to cancel their orders, and other industries had increased
their demand for semiconductors such as electronics and telecommunications.
As more consumers shifted to remote work and the demand
for connectivity increased, so did the demand for semiconductors within
these industries relative to the automotive sector. This created a shortage
where a lack of semiconductor inputs, contributed to a decrease in
expected production. The main hypothesis is that due to the semiconductor
shortage, automobile
